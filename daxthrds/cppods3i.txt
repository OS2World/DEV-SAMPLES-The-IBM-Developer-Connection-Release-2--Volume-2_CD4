The DAB class library at the CTV304 level does not correctly export
the entry points for the class IVBDatastore required for the DAXTHRDS
package.  The problem is seen when an application using IVBDatastore
is dynamically linked (typically using the VB generated makefile).

To fix this problem, the CTV304 level dll and library files need to
be replaced with the updated files available in CPPODS3I.ZIP.
Download and unzip this file, and replace the CTV304 versions of:
  ?:\ibmcpp\lib\cppods3i.lib
  ?:\ibmcpp\dll\cppods3i.dll
  ?:\ibmcpp\bnd\daxscl.bnd
It's a good idea to rename the originals first to save them.

You then need to rebind this new class library to any database that
uses it, via:

  sqlbind ?:\ibmcpp\bnd\daxscl.bnd <database>

This new LIB, DLL and BND combination is not binary compatible with
the CTV304 version - you need to relink any application using this
DLL.
