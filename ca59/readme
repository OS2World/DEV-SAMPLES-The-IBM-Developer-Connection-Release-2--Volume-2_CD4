To install the SupportPac, copy the file CA59.ZIP to a temporary
directory and uncompress using InfoZip's Unzip.  Use the default
options to ensure the subdirectories stored in the ZIP file are
re-created.

The sample application contains two files: 

   readme     - this file 
   ecivbs.htm - HTML file

Open ecivbs.htm using Microsoft Internet Explorer.  Click 'List Servers'
to list the servers defined to your client machine.  Select one and
click 'status' to query the status of the connection - the status query
can be repeated to obtain up to date information.
