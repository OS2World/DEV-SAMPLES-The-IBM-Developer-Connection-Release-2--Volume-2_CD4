What's missing in Java test coverage ?
- AWT FVT Level tests.
- Good/Bad returns. Exceptions.
- Printing
- JCK not sufficient.
- Video configurations.
- Can we sit down and review the JCK to see how good/bad it is ?
- Can we pick up the new JavaSoft testing tools ? (10 licenses in fall plan).
-- > Java-scope.
-- > Java-spec.

- KRL Test bucket, could it be run by the SVT team ?
-- > If so can Hursley do it ?
-- > What about regression for performance pak ?

- Should we be doing more extensive video testing ?
-- > We are for perf pak.

-- > Perhaps we need to expand the coverage of different video modes and
video memory configurations. (Resolutions/Colours/Memory).

- Need to try different printer devices and many different printer tests.

Extend application coverage.
-- > Would we have found enter key not working problem ?
-- > Host On Demand.
-- > Which applications could we add to our bucket ?
-- > Can we get more from the Soyring/Roberts team (need better
integration with that team).
-- > Visual Age Java
-- > Lotus Bean Machine

Keyboards
-- > Could use extended FVT level testing.
-- > How much NLV testing was done on keyboards in Hursley ?
-- > How many different NLV tests do Hursley run.

Internationalization
--> Being beefed up by FVT for next revision to cover more "locale like"
things.

Shell Integration
-- > Is any one officially testing this ?

Stress Testing
-- > Can we get stress testing done any sooner ?
-- > Cannot do stress earlier unless function is stable.
-- > Garbage collection testing needs improving.  Would perf team run this ?
-- > JIT testing needs improving. Perf idiom tests ?
-- > More JIT testing before it comes to Austin.

Java Beans
-- > Are we running enough Java Beans based apps.
-- > we currently don't test the BDK.

Server Sider
-- > Need more servlett coverage.
-- > Need to synch up with the ICS folks.

JDBC
-- > Need some DB2 workload tests.
-- > Need to test that we work with the code that Toronto is providing.

Netscape
-- > Need tests that work with the Netscape <--> Java bridge if we ship it.

Debugger
-- > Should we do any ICAT testing ?
-- > Probably not.

Compatibility Testing
-- > Do we do enough to make sure that apps work the same on NT and OS/2 etc?
-- > We still don't have a Solaris box.
-- > We still don't have enough AIX boxes.

New support
-- > Performance pak graphics etc.
-- > Codepage 1208 support (In perf pak).
