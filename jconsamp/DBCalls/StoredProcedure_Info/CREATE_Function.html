<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>procedure-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Names the procedure being defined. It is a qualified or unqualified name
that designates a stored procedure. The unqualified form of
<VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is an SQL identifier (with a maximum length of 18). An
unqualified <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is implicitly qualified by the
authorization ID. The qualified form is a schema-name followed by a period and
an SQL identifier. 
<P>The name, including the implicit or explicit qualifiers, together with the
number of parameters must not identify a procedure described in the catalog
(SQLSTATE 42723). The unqualified name, together with the number of the
parameters, while of course unique within its schema, need not be unique
across schemas. 
<P>If a qualifed name is specified, the schema-name cannot begin with
&quot;SYS&quot;. Otherwise, an error (SQLSTATE 42939) is raised.
<P><DT><VAR>(</VAR> IN&nbsp;|&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;|&nbsp;INOUT <VAR>parameter-name
data-type,...)</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the parameters of the procedure, and specifies the mode, name
and data type of each parameter. One entry in the list must be specified for
each parameter that the procedure will expect.  
<P>It is possible to register a procedure that has no parameters. In this
case, the parentheses must still be coded, with no intervening data types. For
example, 
<PRE>  <B>CREATE PROCEDURE</B> SUBWOOFER() ...
</PRE> 
<P>No two identically-named procedures within a schema are permitted to have
exactly the same number of parameters. Lengths, precisions and scales are not
considered in this type comparison. Therefore CHAR(8) and CHAR(35) are
considered to be the same type, as are DECIMAL(11,2) and DECIMAL (4,3). There
is some further bundling of types that causes them to be treated as the same
type for this purpose, such as DECIMAL and NUMERIC. A duplicate signature
raises an SQL error (SQLSTATE 42723). 
<P>For example, given the statements&#58; 
<PRE>  <B>CREATE PROCEDURE</B> PART (<B>IN</B> NUMBER <B>INT</B>, <B>OUT</B> PART_NAME <B>CHAR</B>(35)) ...
  <B>CREATE PROCEDURE</B> PART (<B>IN</B> COST <B>DECIMAL</B>(5,3), <B>OUT</B> COUNT <B>INT</B>) ...
</PRE> 
<P>the second statement will fail because the number of parameters of the
procedure are the same even if the data types are not. 
<DL>
<P><DT>IN&nbsp;|&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;|&nbsp;INOUT
<P><DD>Specifies the mode of the parameter. 
<UL>
<P><LI>IN - parameter is input only
<P><LI>OUT - parameter is output only
<P><LI>INOUT - parameter is both input and output
</UL>
<P><DT><VAR>parameter-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the name of the parameter.
<P><DT><VAR>data-type</VAR>
<P><DD>Specifies the data type of the parameter. 
<UL>
<P><LI>SQL data type specifications and abbreviations which may be specified in
the <VAR>data-type</VAR> definition of a CREATE TABLE statement and have a
correspondence in the language that is being used to write the procedure may
be specified. See the language-specific sections of the <CITE>Embedded SQL Programming Guide</CITE> for details on the mapping between the SQL data types and host
language data types with respect to store procedures.
</UL>
</DL>
<P><DT>SPECIFIC <VAR>specific-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Provides a unique name for the instance of the procedure that is being
defined. This specific name can be used when dropping the procedure or
commenting on the procedure. It can never be used to invoke the procedure. The
unqualified form of <VAR>specific-name</VAR> is an SQL identifier (with a
maximum length of 18). The qualified form is a <VAR>schema-name</VAR> followed
by a period and an SQL identifier. The name, including the implicit or
explicit qualifier, must not identify another procedure instance that exists
at the application server; otherwise an error (SQLSTATE 42710) is raised. 
<P>The <VAR>specific-name</VAR> may be the same as an existing
<VAR>procedure-name</VAR>. 
<P>If no qualifier is specified, the qualifier that was used for
<VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is used. If a qualifier is specified, it must be the
same as the explicit or implicit qualifier of <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> or an
error (SQLSTATE 42882) is raised. 
<P>If <VAR>specific-name</VAR> is not specified, a unique name is generated by
the database manager. The unique name is SQL followed by a character timestamp,
SQLyymmddhhmmsshhn.
<P><DT>RESULT SETS <VAR>integer</VAR>
<P><DD>Indicates the estimated upper bound of returned result sets for the stored
procedure. 
<P><DT>EXTERNAL
<P><DD>This clause indicates that the CREATE PROCEDURE statement is being used to
register a new procedure based on code written in an external programming
language and adhering to the documented linkage conventions and interface. 
<P>If NAME clause is not specified "NAME <VAR>procedure-name</VAR>" is assumed. 
<DL>
<P><DT>NAME <VAR>&#39;string&#39;</VAR>
<P><DD>This clause identifies the name of the user-written code which implements
the procedure being defined. 
<P>The &#39;string&#39; option is a string constant with a maximum of 254
characters. The format used for the string is dependent on the LANGUAGE
specified. 
<UL>
<P><LI>For LANGUAGE C&#58; 
<P>The <VAR>string</VAR> specified is the library name and procedure within the
library, which the database manager invokes to execute the stored procedure
being CREATEd. The library (and the procedure within the library) do not need
to exist when the CREATE PROCEDURE statement is performed. However, when the
procedure is called, the library and procedure within the library must exist
and be accessible from the database server machine. 
<PRE>
>>-&#39;--+-<i>library_id</i>-------+-+-------------+--&#39;------------------>&lt;
      +-<i>absolute_path_id</i>-+ +-!--<i>proc_id</i>--+
</PRE> 
<P>The name must be enclosed in single quotes. Extraneous blanks are not
permitted within the single quotes. 
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>library_id</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the library name containing the procedure. The database manager
will look for the library in the .../sqllib/function/unfenced directory and the
.../sqllib/function directory (UNIX-based systems), or
...&#92;sqllib&#92;function&#92;unfenced directory and the...&#92;sqllib&#92;function directory (OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows NT), where the database manager will locate the controlling sqllib
directory which is being used to run the database manager. For example, the
controlling sqllib directory in UNIX-based systems is /u/$DB2INSTANCE/sqllib. 
<P>If &#39;myproc&#39; were the <VAR>library_id</VAR> in a UNIX-based system
it would cause the database manager to look for the procedure in library /u/production/sqllib/function/unfenced/myfunc and 
/u/production/sqllib/function/myfunc, provided the database manager is being
run from /u/production. 
<P>Stored procedures located in any of these directories do not use any of the
registered attributes.
<P><DT><VAR>absolute_path_id</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the full path name of the procedure. 
<P>In a UNIX-based system, for example, &#39;/u/jchui/mylib/myproc&#39;
would cause the database manager to look in /u/jchui/mylib for the myproc
procedure. 
<P>In OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows NT &#39;d&#58;&#92;mylib&#92;myproc&#39; would cause the
database manager to load the myproc.dll file from the d&#58;&#92;mylib
directory. 
<P>If absolute path is specified, the procedure will run as fenced, ignoring
the FENCED or NOT FENCED attribute.
<P><DT><VAR>! proc_id</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the entry point name of the procedure to be invoked. The !
serves as a delimiter between the library id and the procedure id. If <VAR>!
proc_id</VAR> is omitted, the database manager will use the default entry point
established when the library was linked. 
<P>In a UNIX-based system, for example, &#39;mymod!proc8&#39; would direct
the database manager to look for the library
$inst_home_dir/sqllib/function/mymod and to use entry point proc8 within that
library. 
<P>In OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows NT &#39;mymod!proc8&#39; would direct the database manager to load
the mymod.dll file and call the proc8() procedure in the dynamic link library
(DLL).
</DL> 
<P>If the string is not properly formed, an error (SQLSTATE 42878) is raised. 
<P>The body of every stored procedure should be in a directory which is
mounted and available on every partition of the database.
<P><LI>For LANGUAGE JAVA&#58; 
<P>The <VAR>string</VAR> specified is the class identifier and method
identifier, which the database manager invokes to execute the stored procedure
being CREATEd. The class identifier and method identifier do not need to exist
when the CREATE PROCEDURE statement is performed. However, when the procedure
is called, the class identifier and the method identifier must exist and be accessible from the
database server machine, otherwise an error (SQLSTATE 42884) is raised. 
<PRE>
>>-&#39;--<i>class_id</i>--!--<i>method_id</i>--&#39;-------------------------------->&lt;
</PRE> 
<P>The name must be enclosed in single quotes. Extraneous blanks are not
permitted within the single quotes. 
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>class_id</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the class identifier of the Java object. If the class is part
of a package, the class identifier part must include the complete package
prefix, for example, "myPacks.StoredProcs". The Java virtual machine will
look in directory "../myPacks/StoredProcs/" for the classes. In OS/2 and
Windows 95 and Windows NT, the Java virtual machine will look in directory
"..\myPacks\StoredProcs\".
<P><DT><VAR>method_id</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the method name within the Java class to be invoked.
</DL>
</UL>
<P><DT>NAME <VAR>identifier</VAR>
<P><DD>This <VAR>identifier</VAR> specified is an SQL identifier. The SQL
identifier is used as the <VAR>library-id</VAR> in the string. Unless it is a
delimited identifier, the identifier is folded to upper case. If the
identifier is qualified with a schema name, the schema name portion is
ignored. This form of NAME can only be used with LANGUAGE C.
</DL>
<P><DT>LANGUAGE
<P><DD>This mandatory clause is used to specify the language interface convention
to which the stored procedure body is written. 
<DL>
<P><DT><B>C
</B><DD>This means the database manager will call the stored procedure as if it
were a C procedure. The stored procedure must conform to the C language
calling and linkage convention as defined by the standard ANSI C prototype.
<P><DT><B>JAVA
</B><DD>This means the database manager will call the stored procedure as a method
in a Java class.
</DL>
<P><DT>PARAMETER STYLE
<P><DD>This clause is used to specify the conventions used for passing parameters
to and returning the value from stored procedures. 
<DL>
<P><DT><B>DB2DARI
</B><DD>This means that the stored procedure will use a parameter passing
convention that conforms to C language calling and linkage conventions. This
must be specified when LANGUAGE C is used.
<P><DT><B>DB2GENERAL
</B><DD>This means that the stored procedure will use a parameter passing
convention that is defined for use with Java methods. This must be specified
when LANGUAGE JAVA is used. 
<P>The value DB2GENRL may be used as a synonym for DB2GENERAL.
</DL>
<P>
<P>Refer to <CITE>Embedded SQL Programming Guide</CITE> for details on passing parameters.
<P><DT>DETERMINISTIC &nbsp;or&nbsp; NOT DETERMINISTIC
<P><DD>This clause specifies whether the function always returns the same results
for given argument values (DETERMINISTIC) or whether the function depends on
some state values that affect the results (NOT DETERMINISTIC). That is, a
DETERMINISTIC function must always return the same result from successive
invocations with identical inputs.
<P><DT>FENCED &nbsp;or&nbsp; NOT FENCED
<P><DD>This clause specifies whether or not the stored procedure is considered
"safe" to run in the database manager operating environment&#39;s
process or address space (NOT FENCED), or not (FENCED). 
<P>If a stored procedure is registered as FENCED, the database manager
insulates its internal resources (e.g. data buffers) from access by the
procedure. All procedures have the option of running as FENCED or NOT FENCED. In general, a
procedure running as FENCED will not perform as well as a similar one running
as NOT FENCED. 
<P>If the stored procedure is located in
...&#92;sqllib&#92;function&#92;unfenced directory and the
...&#92;sqllib&#92;function directory (UNIX-based systems), or
...&#92;sqllib&#92;function&#92;unfenced directory and the
...&#92;sqllib&#92;function directory (OS/2, Windows 95 and Windows
NT), then the FENCED or NOT FENCED registered attribute (and every other
registered attribute) will be ignored. 
<TABLE><TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><B>Warning:</B></TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Use of NOT FENCED for procedures not adequately checked out can compromise
the integrity of DB2. DB2 takes some precautions against many of the common
types of inadvertent failures that might occur, but cannot guarantee complete
integrity when NOT FENCED stored procedures are used.
</td></tr></table> 
<P>To change from FENCED to NOT FENCED, the procedure must be re-registered
(by first dropping it and then re-creating it). Either SYSADM authority, DBADM
authority or a special authority (CREATE_NOT_FENCED) is required to register a
stored procedures as NOT FENCED.
<P><DT>NULL CALL
<P><DD>NULL CALL always applies to stored procedures. This means that regardless
if any arguments are null, the stored procedure is called. It can return a null value or a normal (non-null) value.
Responsibility for testing for null argument values lies with the stored
procedure.
</DL>
<P><STRONG>Notes</STRONG>
<UL>
<P><LI>For information on creating the programs for a stored procedure, see the
<CITE>Embedded SQL Programming Guide</CITE>.
<P><LI>Creating a procedure with a schema name that does not already exist will
result in the implicit creation of that schema provided the authorization ID
of the statement has IMPLICIT_SCHEMA authority. The schema owner is SYSIBM.
The CREATEIN privilege on the schema is granted to PUBLIC.
