<P>
<P>Invokes a procedure stored at the location of a database. A stored
procedure, for example, executes at the location of the database, and returns
data to the client application.
<P>Programs using the SQL CALL statement are designed to run in two parts, one
on the client and the other on the server. The server procedure at the
database runs within the same transaction as the client application. If the
client application and stored procedure are on the same partition, the stored procedure is executed locally.
<P><STRONG>Invocation</STRONG>
<P>This statement can only be embedded in an application program. It is an
executable statement that cannot be dynamically prepared. However, the
procedure name may be specified via a host variable and this, coupled with the
use of the USING DESCRIPTOR clause, allows both the procedure name and the
parameter list to be provided at run time; thus achieving the same effect as a
dynamically prepared statement.
<P><STRONG>Authorization</STRONG>
<P>The authorization rules vary according to the server at which the procedure
is stored.

<P><STRONG>Description</STRONG>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>procedure-name</VAR> &nbsp;or&nbsp; <VAR>host-variable</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies the procedure to call. The procedure name may be specified
either directly or within a host variable. The procedure identified must exist
at the current server (SQLSTATE 42724). 
<P>If <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is specified it must be an ordinary identifier
not greater than 254 bytes. Since this can only be an ordinary identifier, it
cannot contain blanks or special characters and the value is converted to
upper case. Thus, if it is necessary to use lower case names, blanks or
special characters, the name must be specified via a <VAR>host-variable</VAR>. 
<P>If <VAR>host-variable</VAR> is specified, it must be a character-string
variable with a length attribute that is not greater than 254 bytes, and it
must not include an indicator variable. Note that the value is <B>not</B>
converted to upper case. <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> must be left-justified. 
<P>The procedure name can take one of several forms. The forms supported vary
according to the server at which the procedure is stored. 
<DL>
<P><DT>DB2 Universal Database&#58;
<DD>
<DL>
<P><DT><VAR>procedure-name</VAR>
<DD>The name (with no extension) of the procedure to execute. The procedure
invoked is determined as follows. 
<OL>
<P><LI>The <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is used both as the name of the stored
procedure library and the function name within that library. For example, if
<VAR>procedure-name</VAR> is <TT>proclib</TT>, the DB2 server will load the
stored procedure library named <TT>proclib</TT> and execute the function
routine <TT>proclib()</TT> within that library. 
<P>In UNIX-based systems, the DB2 server finds the stored procedure library in
the default directory <TT>sqllib/function</TT>. Unfenced stored procedures
are in the <TT>sqllib/function/unfenced</TT> directory. 
<P>In OS/2, the location of the stored procedures is specified by the LIBPATH
variable in the CONFIG.SYS file. Unfenced stored procedures are in the
<TT>sqllib&#92;dll&#92;unfenced</TT> directory.
<P><LI>If the library or function could not be found, the <VAR>procedure-name</VAR>
is used to search the defined procedures (in SYSCAT.PROCEDURES) for a matching
procedure. A matching procedure is determined using the steps that follow. 
<OL>
<P><LI>Find the procedures from the catalog (SYSCAT.PROCEDURES) where the
PROCNAME matches the <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> specified and the PROCSCHEMA is a
schema name in the function path.
<P><LI>Next, eliminate any of these procedures that do not have the same number
of parameters as the number of arguments specified in the CALL statement.
<P><LI>Chose the remaining procedure that is earliest in the function path.
<P><LI>If there are no remaining procedures after step 2, an error is returned
(SQLSTATE 42884).
</OL>
<P>Once the procedure is selected, DB2 will invoke the procedure defined by
the external name.
</OL>
<P><DT><VAR>procedure-library!function-name</VAR>
<DD>The exclamation character (!) , acts as a delimiter between the library
name and the function name of the stored procedure. For example, if
<TT>proclib!func</TT> was specified, then <TT>proclib</TT> would be loaded
into memory and the function <TT>func</TT> from that library would be
executed. This allows multiple functions to be placed in the same stored
procedure library. 
<P>The stored procedure library is located in the directories or specified in
the LIBPATH variable, as described in <VAR>procedure-name</VAR>.
<P><DT><VAR>absolute-path!function-name</VAR>
<DD>The <VAR>absolute-path</VAR> specifies the complete path to the stored
procedure library. 
<P>In a UNIX-based system, for example, if <TT>/u/terry/proclib!func</TT>
was specified, then the stored procedure library <TT>proclib</TT> would be
obtained from the directory <TT>/u/terry</TT> and the function
<TT>func</TT> from that library would be executed. 
<P>In OS/2, if <TT>d&#58;&#92;terry&#92;proclib!func</TT> was
specified, then it would cause the database manager to load the func.dll file
from the <TT>d&#58;&#92;terry&#92;proclib</TT> directory.
</DL>
<P>
<P>In all these cases, the total length of the procedure name including its
implicit or explicit full path must not be longer than 254 bytes.
<P><DT>DB2 for MVS (V4.1 or later) server&#58;
<DD>An implicit or explicit three part name. The parts are as follows. 
<DL>
<P><DT>high order&#58;
<DD>The location name of the server where the procedure is stored.
<P><DT>middle&#58;
<DD>SYSPROC
<P><DT>middle&#58;
<DD>Some value in the PROCEDURE column of the SYSIBM.SYSPROCEDURES catalog
table.
</DL>
<P><DT>DB2 for OS/400 (V3.1 or later) server&#58;
<DD>The external program name is assumed to be the same as the
<I>procedure-name</I>.
</DL>
<P>
<P>For portability, <VAR>procedure-name</VAR> should be specified as a single
token no larger than 8 bytes.
<P><DT><VAR>(host-variable,...)</VAR>
<P><DD>Each specification of <VAR>host-variable</VAR> is a parameter of the CALL.
The nth parameter of the CALL corresponds to the nth parameter of the
server&#39;s stored procedure. 
<P>Each <VAR>host-variable</VAR> is assumed to be used for exchanging data in
both directions between client and server. In order to avoid sending
unnecessary data between client and server, the client application should
provide an indicator variable with each parameter and set the indicator to -1
if the parameter is not used to transmit data to the stored procedure. The
stored procedure should set the indicator variable to -128 for any parameter
that is not used to return data to the client application. 
<P>If the server is DB2 Universal Database the parameters must have matching
data types in both the client and server program.
<A NAME="Footnote_Used_42" HREF="#Footnote_42" >(42)</A>
<P><DT>USING DESCRIPTOR <VAR>descriptor-name</VAR>
<P><DD>Identifies an SQLDA that must contain a valid description of host
variables. The nth SQLVAR element corresponds to the nth parameter of the
server&#39;s stored procedure. 
<P>Before the CALL statement is processed, the application must set the
following fields in the SQLDA&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>SQLN to indicate the number of SQLVAR occurrences provided in the SQLDA
<P><LI>SQLDABC to indicate the number of bytes of storage allocated for the SQLDA
<P><LI>SQLD to indicate the number of variables used in the SQLDA when processing
the statement
<P><LI>SQLVAR occurrences to indicate the attributes of the variables. The
following fields of each Base SQLVAR element passed must be initialized&#58;
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>SQLTYPE
<LI>SQLLEN
<LI>SQLDATA
<LI>SQLIND
</UL>
<P>The following fields of each Secondary SQLVAR element passed must be
initialized&#58; 
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>LEN&#46;SQLLONGLEN
<LI>SQLDATALEN
<LI>SQLDATATYPE&#95;NAME
</UL>
</UL>
<P>Each SQLDA is assumed to be used for exchanging data in both directions
between client and server. In order to avoid sending unnecessary data between
client and server, the client application should set the SQLIND field to -1 if
the parameter is not used to transmit data to the stored procedure. The stored
procedure should set the SQLIND field -128 for any parameter that is not used
to return data to the client application.
</DL>
<P><A NAME="HDRCALLNTS"><STRONG>Notes</STRONG></A>
<UL>
<P><LI><B><I>Use of Large Object (LOB) data types</I></B>&#58;&nbsp; 
<P>If the client and server application needs to specify LOB data from an
SQLDA, allocate double the number of SQLVAR entries. 
<P>LOB data types are supported by stored procedures in DB2 Version 5. The LOB
data types are not supported by either down level clients or servers. They are
also not supported for requests made from a DRDA application requestor or to a
DRDA application server.
<P><LI><B><I><A NAME="SPTSPRES"></A>Returning Result Sets
from Stored Procedures</I></B>&#58;&nbsp; 
<P>If the client application program is written using CLI, result sets can be
returned directly to the client application. The stored procedure indicates
that a result set is to be returned by declaring a cursor on that result set,
opening a cursor on the result set, and leaving the cursor open when exiting
the procedure. 
<P>At the end of a procedure that is invoked via CLI&#58; 
<UL>
<P><LI>For every cursor that has been left open, a result set is returned to the
application.
<P><LI>If more than one cursor is left open, the result sets are returned in the
order in which their cursors were opened.
<P><LI>Only unread rows are passed back. For example, if the result set of a
cursor has 500 rows, and 150 of those rows have been read by the stored
procedure at the time the stored procedure is terminated, then rows 151
through 500 will be returned to the stored procedure.
</UL>
<P>For additional information refer to the <CITE>Embedded SQL
Programming Guide</CITE> and the <CITE>CLI Guide and Reference</CITE>.
<P><LI><B><I>Inter-operability between the CALL statement and the DARI
API</I></B>&#58;&nbsp; 
<P>In general, the CALL statement will not work with existing DARI procedures.
See the <CITE>Embedded SQL Programming Guide</CITE> for details.

<P><STRONG>Examples</STRONG>
<P><I>Example 1&#58;</I>&nbsp;
<P>In C, invoke a procedure called TEAMWINS in the ACHIEVE library passing it
a parameter stored in the host variable HV_ARGUMENT.

<P><A NAME="Footnote_42" HREF="#Footnote_Used_42" >(42)</A>
Both the DB2 for MVS and DB2/400 servers support conversions between
compatible data types when invoking their stored procedures. For example, if
the client program uses the INTEGER data type and the stored procedure expects
FLOAT, the server will convert the INTEGER value to FLOAT before invoking the
procedure.
