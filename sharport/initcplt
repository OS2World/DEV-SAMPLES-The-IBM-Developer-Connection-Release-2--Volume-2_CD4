; ROUTINE NAME: ProInitComp. Set up IDC with Parallel Port Device Driver.
;
; FUNCTION:     This routine is called after all device drivers are
;               initialized so that device drivers can setup their
;               inter-device driver communications.  This routine
;               removes ordering dependencies from within config.sys.
;               The prototype device driver obtains the parallel port
;               device driver's IDC routine address.
;
; NOTES:        System initialization resized our code segment on return
;               from the init command.  Since the init command happens
;               before init complete, this routine cannot be discarded
;               like the init routine.  The next best thing is to make
;               this routine swappable.
;
;               This routine is called at kernel (task) time, not
;               device driver initialization time.
;
; ENTRY:        es:bx -> kernel request packet
;               ds       our data segment
;
; EXIT:         all other registers are not preserved
;
