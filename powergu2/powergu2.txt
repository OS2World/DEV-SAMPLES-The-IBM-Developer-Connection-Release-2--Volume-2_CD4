OS/2 C++ CLASS LIBRARY: POWER GUI PROGRAMMING WITH C SET ++

SAMPLE UPDATES TO SUPPORT IBM VISUALAGE C++ 3.0 AND OS/2 WARP 3.0
=========================================================================
We have provided this README file with a zip file that contains only
those files changed to support VisualAge C++ and OS/2 Warp 3.0.  Prior
to installing these files, you must install the examples from the disk
shipped with the book, since files that have not changed are not
included in the zip file.  Since many of the changes were made to support
changes in IBM Open Class 3.0, the examples will no longer compile and
link correctly on C Set ++ Version 2.1 once you have applied these
changes.  Do not install the updates unless you plan to use VisualAge C++
Version 3.0.

To install the update, copy POWERGU2.ZIP to the root directory where you
installed the examples from the book (for example, D:\POWERGUI).  Make
that directory the current directory, and explode the file.  For example:
  COPY A:POWERGU2.ZIP D:\POWERGUI
  D:
  CD D:\POWERGUI
  PKUNZIP POWERGU2.ZIP -d -o

Please send any problems installing the updates, errors in the samples,
or inaccuracies in the book to:

   boblove@vnet.ibm.com

If you have "how to" questions on topics not covered in the book, please
append these questions to one of the IBM supported forums.  For example,
the IBM Open Class library developers regularly monitor OS2DF1 Section 5
on CompuServe.


BUGS FOUND ON VISUALAGE C++ AND OS/2 WARP
=========================================================================
1)  In the Title bar bitmap example using system menus (menus\titlebmp),
    the buttons are rearranged after minimizing and restoring the window.
===> This behavior only occurs on OS/2 Warp and we have not developed a
     work around.  If you need title bar bitmaps, see the example that
     uses graphic pushbuttons (buttons\titlebut).

2)  In the Container Spreadsheet example (cnr\spreadsh), the multi-line
    edit field automatically closes when the Tab key is pressed.
===> This is a bug in the Open Class library scheduled to be fixed in
     CSD CTO302.

3)  In the Container Spreadsheet example (cnr\spreadsh), the multi-line
    edit field will overwrite the bottom scroll bar.
===> This is a bug in the Open Class library scheduled to be fixed in
     CSD CTO302.

4)  We fixed a bug in the Container Tree Details example (cnr\treedet),
    where the tree view and details view containers do not stay lined up.

5)  In the Derived Frame Extension example (advframe\drawextn), you must
    resize the frame window before you can see the controls on the frame.
===> This appears to be a bug in IBM Open Class.  We have implemented a
     work around in the example until it can be resolved.

6)  In the Menu Draw Item example (menus\drawmenu), the menu items that
    appear after the item with MI_DRAWITEM style are drawn with an
    incorrect font.
===> This looks like a Presentation Manager bug that occurs to all menu
     items following the menu item with MI_DRAWITEM style.  We have
     implemented a work around in the example.

7)  We fixed the TableObject copy constructor in the Container Spreadsheet
    example (cnr\spreadsh) to correctly copy all of the strings for the
    object.

8)  We removed the SourceFixHandler from the Menu Drag example
    (menus\menudrag), since is no longer necessary.

9)  We removed a work around from the Static Text and Canvas example
    (static\textcv) that is no longer necessary.  We also updated the
    function MultiLineStaticText::calcMinimumSize to use a minimum width
    no smaller than what is needed to display the longest word.

10) We fixed a bug in the Canvas Deck Packing and Alignment
    (canvas\setpack) example where the frame window was being positioned
    above the top of the screen in 1280x1024 resolution.

11) We fixed the Complex Canvas example (canvas\complex) to allow the
    child window of the right-hand view port (a multi-cell canvas) to
    change size if the minimum size of one of its child windows changes
    (for example, as a result of a font drop).  We also updated the
    resizing logic to properly size the child of the view port (it wasn't
    correctly accounting for the size needed by the scroll bars of the
    view port).

12) We fixed the painting in the Listbox Custom Drawing example
    (listctls\drawlist) to honor color drops and palette changes.  We
    also fixed the item height returned by the handler.


VISUALAGE C++ 3.0 INTERFACE AND MAKEFILE CHANGES
=========================================================================
The following changes were made to support Version 3.0 of IBM Open Class.

ALL MAKEFILES
---------------------------------------------------------
==> We removed the library names DDE4MUII.LIB and DDE4CCI.LIB from the
    link step.
==> We added the compiler option /Wppc- to suppress new compiler
    informational messages.

ADVFRAME\DRAWEXTNS
---------------------------------------------------------
myextns.hpp/cpp
==> We changed the return type of separatorWidth from "unsigned" to
    "unsigned long."
==> We changed the function drawSeparators from const to non-const.
==> We added a private copy constructor and assignment operator to
    MyExtension.

DM\MENUDRAG
---------------------------------------------------------
.\cmditem.cpp(87:7) : error EDC3071: Call to "IDMImage::IDMImage" matches more than one function.
==> We added a parameter to the IDMImage constructor call, changing it
    from:
       IDMImage
         image( IResourceId( IC_DEFAULT_FRAME_ID ) );
    to:
       IDMImage
         image( IResourceId( IC_DEFAULT_FRAME_ID ), true );
    This error occurs because IBM Open Class obsoleted an IDMImage
    constructor and the replacement constructor is ambiguous with the old
    one.  A defect is open against the IBM Open Class for this problem,
    so this ambiguity may be fixed in a future CSD.

.\menudrag.cpp(83:30) : error EDC3013: Identifier "IMenuItem" is undefined.
==> We added an include for imnitem.hpp to menudrag.cpp and cmditem.cpp.

HELP\BASIC
---------------------------------------------------------
.\childhlp.cpp(56:30) : error EDC3055: "IFrameWindow*" cannot be converted to "IWindow*".
.\childhlp.cpp(65:36) : error EDC3055: "IFrameWindow*" cannot be converted to "IWindow*".
==> We added an include for iframe.hpp.

.\childhlp.cpp(72:23) : error EDC3013: Identifier "IC_MEMBER_ACCESS_ERROR" is undefined.
==> We added an include for icconst.h.

.\childhlp.cpp(70:50) : informational EDC3126: Argument "window" is not used in function "ChildHelpHandler::handleEventsFor(IWindow*)".
==> We removed the argument name from the definition of these functions.

HELP\SPECIAL
---------------------------------------------------------
.\childhlp.cpp(56:30) : error EDC3055: "IFrameWindow*" cannot be converted to "IWindow*".
.\childhlp.cpp(65:36) : error EDC3055: "IFrameWindow*" cannot be converted to "IWindow*".
==> We added an include for iframe.hpp.

.\childhlp.cpp(72:23) : error EDC3013: Identifier "IC_MEMBER_ACCESS_ERROR" is undefined.

.\childhlp.cpp(70:50) : informational EDC3126: Argument "window" is not used in function "ChildHelpHandler::handleEventsFor(IWindow*)".
==> We removed the argument name from the definition of these functions.

EXCEPTNS\NEWEXCP
---------------------------------------------------------
  custexcp.obj(.\custexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IException::logExceptionData()" : unresolved external
  newexcp.obj(.\newexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IExceptionLocation::IExceptionLocation(const char*,const char*,unsigned long)" : unresolved external

  newexcp.obj(.\newexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IException::~IException()" : unresolved external
  custexcp.obj(.\custexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IException::isRecoverable() const" : unresolved external
  custexcp.obj(.\custexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IException::IException(const IException&)" : unresolved external
  newexcp.obj(.\newexcp.cpp) : error LNK2029: "IException::IException(const IException&)" : unresolved external
==> We added an include for ibase.hpp.
    These errors occur because this example only uses the exception
    classes, and consequently only included iexcbase.hpp.  This file does
    not specify the appropriate pragma library directives, and does not
    include another file that does (like ibase.hpp).  This is a defect in
    IBM Open Class.

FRAME1\DIALOG
---------------------------------------------------------
.\dialog.cpp(44:15) : error EDC3205: Syntax error - "IApplication" is followed by "::" but is not the name of a class.

==> We renamed dde4xtra.obj to cppopa3.obj in the makefile, to reflect
    the file's new name.

MENUS\SYSMENU
---------------------------------------------------------
.\sysmenu.cpp(26:11) : error EDC3013: Identifier "IMenuItem" is undefined.
==> We added an include for imnitem.hpp.

---------------------------------------------------------
listdhdr.hpp(46:3) : warning EDC3293: "DrawHandler::drawItem(IListBoxDrawItemEvent&,IBase::Boolean)" hides the virtual function "IListBoxDrawItemHandler::drawItem(IListBoxDrawItemEvent&)".
