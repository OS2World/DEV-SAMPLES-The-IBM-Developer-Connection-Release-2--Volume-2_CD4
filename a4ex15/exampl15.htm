<h1>Program that is replacement for finite()</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This function checks if a number is finite. It determines if the passed floating point number represents an overflow condition.

If the exponent of an AS/400 double (which is 8 byte) is all 1's and fraction is all 0's then it is infinite. Bits in an AS/400 double are:

           0     sign
           1:11  exponent
           12:63 fraction
                                                                    
Bit 0 is the leftmost bit.
