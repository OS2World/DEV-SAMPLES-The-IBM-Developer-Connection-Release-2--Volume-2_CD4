<P>                                                                                    

<P>This page gives guidance on the <A HREF="#inst">Installation</A> and 
the <A HREF="#exe">Execution</A> of the CICS EXCI CGI sample program.

<P>To use the CICS EXCI CGI sample you need to :
<OL>
<LI>Save this HTML file into the directory from which your Web Server 
retrieves HTML pages giving it the file extension 'html'.
<LI>Retrieve CICSESA.gif  into the directory from which your Web Server 
retrieves images.
<P><STRONG>Note: </STRONG>Remember to use 'binary' mode where applicable 
when transferring gif images.<P>
<LI>Retrieve EXCICGI.c to your MVS 5.2.2 system and follow the 
<A HREF="#inst">instructions</A> below.
<LI>Adapt this HTML page as <A HREF="#inst">described below</A>.
</OL>

<P>This page provides access to a sample CGI program that invokes 
CICS by using the CICS External Call Interface or EXCI.
The EXCI was introduced in CICS/ESA version 4.1 and is
supported by all subsequent versions. The use of the
EXCI interface is documented in the CICS/ESA External CICS
Interface manual which is document number SC33-1390-00.
Section 7.4 of the EXCI manual describes the operation of
the EXCI sample programs as well as the installation steps required
to use them.
You should read <STRONG>AT LEAST</STRONG> this section of the EXCI 
manual. 
<P>Prior to running the 
<A HREF="http://server_name/cgi-bin/excicgi">MVS ICS CICS 
EXCI CGI sample</A>
you <STRONG>MUST</STRONG> follow the installation steps documented in 
the manual above and verify the installation as described.

<P>To adapt this page edit the HTML source and replace 'gif_path' with         
the directory path from which your Web Server will retrieve CICSESA.gif        
and replace 'server_name' with the DNS name or IP address of you Web           
Server.                                                                        

<P>EXCICGI.c is the C program which implements the EXCI CGI function. 
This program must be translated with the CICS translator specifying the 
EXCI option.

<P>EXCICGI.c can be complied and link edited from within the OpenEdition
environment. To achieve this ensure that the OpenEdition compiler, C89, 
is correctly set up and follow these steps :
<OL>
<LI>Copy the translated EXCICGI.c source into your working HFS 
directory.
<LI>Copy the C language EXCI copybook DFHXCPLH into your working HFS 
directory as dfhxcplh.h
<LI>Create a file named 'Makefile' in your working HFS directory and 
using OEDIT edit following make commands into it by 
editing away all the other HTML source of this page.
<P><STRONG>Note : </STRONG>if you use a 'cut & paste' type operation instead
of an edit, as suggested above, to  
extract the Makefile commands, ensure that the TAB boundaries are
preserved as otherwise errors will be generated during the Make processing.
<PRE>
#Makefile to compile the CICS CGI sample code.

CC=c89
AR=ar
CFLAGS=-O -W0,"LANGLVL(EXTENDED)"
LIB1=-L./
LIB2=-lc -lm -l"//'CICS.HLQ.SDFHEXCI'"

all: excicgi

excicgi: excicgi.o
	$(CC) -o excicgi $(LIB1) excicgi.o	$(LIB2)

clean:
	rm -f *.o *.a excicgi

</PRE>
<LI>Change 'CICS.HLQ' within the Makefile to be the high level qualifier
used for the CICS datasets in your environment.
<LI>Issue the 'make' command from the shell command line in your working 
HFS directory to perform the compile.
<LI>Copy, using the cp command, the executable produced 'excicgi' to the
HFS directory from which your Web Server will resolve CGI requests, 
this is usually the cgi-bin directory.
<LI>Ensure that the CICS EXCI Runtime function is accessible from the 
OpenEdition environment, the most reliable way of ensuring this is to 
place the modules from the Library SDFHEXCI into the LPA.
</OL>

<P><Strong>Note :</Strong> Help on copying files between TSO and the HFS 
can be found in the MVS/ESA OpenEdition MVS User's Guide (SC23-3013-02).

<P>You are now ready to drive the EXCICGI program. Initialise CICS and 
enable the EXCI environment as described in the CICS/ESA External CICS 
Interface manual. Point your Web Browser at this page initially, and use
the 'links' to invoke EXCICGI.  Remember to specify the APPLID of your 
CICS system in upper case when prompted to do so by a fill out form.
