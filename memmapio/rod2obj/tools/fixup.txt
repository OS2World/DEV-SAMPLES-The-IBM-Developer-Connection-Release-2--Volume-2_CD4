// This is a fixup patch file. This is an optional file in order to patch
// your read only files in memory. This can be used for R/O databases that
// have live object pointers in them: The syntax is as follows:
// (Add Comments here only)
//
// Column 1 - 32 Bit Offset into R/O data that will have a fixup(relocation)
//            applied
//
// Column 2 - 1. Nothing specified
//                 This causes the tool to generate a seg relative fixup
//                 The loader will extract the information in the field
//                 pointed to by the fixup record and apply a delta address
//                 to it, then reinsert it back into the original offset.
//
//            2. 32 Bit Cont
//                 This is a patch value that will be placed directly into
//                 R/O Data. No relocation will be generated for this field.
//
//            3. Symbol Name
//                 This will generate and undefined external symbol
//                 definition that the linker will try to resolv via an obj
//                 or libarary.
