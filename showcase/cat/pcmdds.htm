<LI>IBM does not warrant that the contents of the source code examples, whether individually or as one or more groups, will meet your requirements or that the source code examples are error-free.
<LI>IBM may make improvements and/or changes in the source code examples at any time.
<LI>Changes may be made periodically to the information in the source code examples; these changes may be reported, for the sample device drivers included herein, in new editions of the examples.
<LI>References in the source code examples to IBM products, programs, or services do not imply that IBM intends to make these available in all countries in which IBM operates.  Any reference to an IBM licensed program in the source code examples is not intended to state or imply that only IBM's licensed program may be used.  Any functionally equivalent program may be used.
