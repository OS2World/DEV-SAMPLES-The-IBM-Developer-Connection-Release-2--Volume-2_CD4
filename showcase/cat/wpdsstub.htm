Sample Code-->
<P>
WPDSSTUB is the sample code referenced by the article
"Workplace Shell and DSOM: Together at Last" in The Developer Connection News, Volume 6.
WPDSSTUB demonstrates how to use a feature of Warp called Distributed SOM (DSOM).  DSOM provides a
framework that allows application programs to access objects across address spaces.  This means
that you now can call Workplace Shell methods from other processes.
<P>
WPDSSTUB will start the Workplace Shell DSOM server and then create a number of
objects on your desktop before terminating.
<P>
This sample code can be run only on OS/2 Warp.
