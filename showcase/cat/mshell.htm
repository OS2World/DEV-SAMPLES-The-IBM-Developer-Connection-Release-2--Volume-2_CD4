MShell is a mini PM shell for OS/2 2.x.  It is a program launcher that uses the
RUNWORKPLACE architecture of the Workplace Shell.  You can configure programs by editing
a plain-text .INI file.
<P>
Refer to "The Shell Game - Alternative Shells for OS/2" in The Developer Connection
News, Volume 3, for a discussion of MShell.

<BIG><b>Installation Instructions:</b></BIG>

<!-- cd start -->

<P>To install from the CD:
<OL>
<LI>Copy \mshell\mshell.exe from the CD into the root directory of the boot
drive.
<LI>Edit CONFIG.SYS and modify the SET for RUNWORKPLACE to specify mshell.exe.
For example:  <B>SET RUNWORKPLACE=C:\MSHELL.EXE</B>
<LI>If you boot OS/2 from a drive other than C:, modify RUNWORKPLACE
accordingly.  When mshell.exe runs, it looks for mshell.ini in the root
directory of the boot drive.  If there is no mshell.ini, mshell will create
one for you.
<LI>Shut down and reboot.
</OL>

<!-- cd end -->
