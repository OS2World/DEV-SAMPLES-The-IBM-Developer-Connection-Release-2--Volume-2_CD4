OS/2 Warp Version 4 provides three new APIs which provide inking function in a window or on the
desktop.  This program, INKPS.EXE, demonstrates some of the things that can be done with these new APIs.
<P>
The program works with the mouse.  Pressing and holding mouse button 1 allows the "ink" to start
flowing.  You can stop the ink flow by releasing MB1 and then start and stop writing as often as
you want.
<P>
Double clicking mouse button 2 ends the ink path, and if you are using the
XOR or INVERT Foreground mix modes can delete the ink from the screen.  The
Attributes menu allows you to change colors, line thinkness, mix modes, etc.
<P>
The source code has been provided.
<P>
This program will not work with OS/2 Warp Version 3.
