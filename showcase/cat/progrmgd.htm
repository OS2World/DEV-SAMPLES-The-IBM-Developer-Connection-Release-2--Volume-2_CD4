<P>This book contains information you will need to write, load, and invoke
<B>servlets</B>. It also describes the ServletExpress class extensions to
the Java Servlet API and contains instructions for using the sample
applications and servlets shipped with ServletExpress. </P>

<P>Servlets are Java programs that use additional packages, and the
associated classes and methods, in the JavaSoft Java Servlet Application
Programming Interface (API). Similar to the way applets run on a browser
and extend the browser's capabilities, servlets run on a Java-enabled Web
server and extend the server's capabilities. </P>

<P>Servlets extend the capabilities of the server by creating a framework
for providing request/response services over the Web. When a client sends
a request to the server, the server can send the request information to a
servlet and have the servlet construct the response that the server sends
back to the client. </P>

<P>A servlet can be loaded automatically when the Web server is started, or
it can be loaded the first time a client requests its services. After
loading, a servlet continues to run, waiting for additional client
requests. </P>
