<BIG><B>ROTLINE.EXE - Sample program</B></BIG>-->
<P>
This sample program shows how to write a well-behaved, responsive, two-threaded CPI graphics
application.  It is the sample program described in the article "Writing Multithreaded Graphics
Programs" in The Developer Connection News.  This sample is
the full source and executables for this program.
<P>
Rotline is a two-threaded, menu-driven, PM application that lets the user select one of
five drawing options: spirals, expanding cubes, rotating cubes, multiple polygons, or
rotating text.  It uses a second thread to do the drawing, while the main
thread receives user input.  The user can stop drawing and change the shape being drawn at any time.
