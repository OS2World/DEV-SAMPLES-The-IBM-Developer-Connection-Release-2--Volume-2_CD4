<!-- "Porting Windows and OS/2 Based Applications to Java"
Sample Code (grid_layout.java) -->
<p>
<i><b>grid_layout.java</i></b> is the sample code referenced in the
article by Kelvin Lawrence that was published in the December 1997
issue of the <i>IBM Developer Connection Technical Magazine.</i> The
article is entitled <cite>Porting Windows and OS/2 Based Applications
to Java</cite>. The article is an introduction to using and exploiting Java's
Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT).
<p>
This code is a simple Java program that creates a frame window
and uses the GridLayout manager to create a three-by-three grid of
pushbuttons as discussed in the article.  The article is available on
the Developer Connection Web site at
<a href=http://www.developer.ibm.com/devcon/">www.developer.ibm.com/devcon/</a>.
