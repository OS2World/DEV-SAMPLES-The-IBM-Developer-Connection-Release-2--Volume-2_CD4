Version: CA81
<P>
<b>Platform:</b> OS/2 -->
<P>
The sample COBOL programs supplied in this SupportPac show how a CICS application can be accessed from the World Wide Web using the External Call Interface (ECI) available as part of the CICS Client for OS/2.
<P>
The programs interact with a supplied CICS for OS/2 backend application which is part of the TECHDEMO developed by the Transaction Processing Marketing Team at IBM's Hursley Laboratories in the UK.
<P>
The sample programs are supplied as both source files and compiled executables. They illustrate how COBOL can be used to write a CGI program that will interface with the CICS External Call Interface and thus permit access to CICS server applications from the WWW.
<P>
Skill level required is familiarity with CICS for OS/2, COBOL and CGI programming.
