PMCX - What's Zat?

Source Code -->
<P>
In the Volume 8 issue of The Developer Connections News, we introduced the Universal Resource Editor (URE) and briefly touched upon PMCX controls.  Well, what are these PMCX controls all about?
<P>
PMCX stands for PM Control Extensions.  In a nutshell, it's a mechanism that lets you integrate and use custom controls within applications and design tools such as the Universal Resource Editor.
<P>
It is very easy to create a custom control to use within an application, but it has been very difficult to add or maintain your resource script files to be able to use the custom control within your dialogs.
<P>
PMCX makes this whole process much easier.  It basically allows for a custom control to be "wrappered" in a manner that can be then clipped into tools like URE so you can treat the control almost like a standard Presentation Manager (PM) control.
This includes the visual display of the control within a window or dialog and, for a styles dialog, allows the changing of the text and styles of the control.
<P>
The best way to show you how this all works is through an example.  The sample PMCX control, BANNER.DLL, was created specifically for this article.  URE provides a wealth of sample PMCX controls with full source.
