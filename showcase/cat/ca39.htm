<BIG><b>CA39: CICS for OS/2 link extra for Lotus Notes</b></BIG>
<BR>
Version: CA39
<P>
<b>Platform:</b> OS/2-->
<P>
This Supportpac contains the CICS for OS/2 link extra for Lotus Notes software developers kit.
<P>
CICS link extra provides CICS applications with a means of sending data to a Lotus Notes environment. This data can be used to update or add one or more documents to a Lotus Notes database. Document updates may span more than one database. The user specifies what action to take using a combination of key fields and rules.
<P>
The previous announcement of 'CICS link for Lotus Notes' allowed Lotus Notes users to initiate the interaction with an CICS application. The new function provided in 'CICS link extra for Lotus Notes' allows an application on any of the CICS supported platforms to initiate the sending of data to the Lotus Notes user. The CICS link extra allows data from non-Notes environments to be integrated into Lotus Notes. A link database provides mapping between the system application and fields defined in the Lotus Notes databases.
<P>
A customer with strong CICS skills, and Notes application skills should find the CICS link extra code easy to install and use.
<P>
However, for customers who are not strong in BOTH skill sets, IBM can provide fee-based services to assist in integrating and re-engineering specific applications to take advantage of the interconnectivity between Notes
and transaction processing or other non-Notes environments. In the United States, you may contact IBM ISSC for additional services (914 759-2949). These services include: MQSeries link extra for Lotus Notes education, consultation, and application development. This number should only be used by IBM Marketing or by ISSC personnel in support of billable customer engagements. ISSC TS-N reserves the right of refusal.
