<BR>
Version:  1.0-->
<P>
NewShow is a sample written in C++ using the Direct Video
Extensions (DIVE) of OS/2 Warp and the IBM Open Class libraries of VisualAge C++ 3.0.
<P>
This sample is functionally equivalent to the Show (jet) sample currently in the Toolkit
(samples\mm\dive), and runs just as fast as its C counterpart.  Hence, NewShow illustrates
how to write an easy-to-use Dive class in C++, without sacrificing
speed and performance.  This sample accompanies the article "NewShow: A C++ Dive sample"
found in The Developer Connection for OS/2 News, Volume 9.
