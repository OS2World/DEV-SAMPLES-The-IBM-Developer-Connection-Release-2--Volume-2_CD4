This SupportPac provides three sample programs which illustrate how non-CICS programs using Micro Focus
COBOL V3 can be used to access both CICS for OS/2 VSAM (Btrieve) files and Sequential datasets.
<P>
The sample programs are supplied as both source files and compiled executables.
They may be used to illustrate how COBOL programs can access VSAM and Sequential
files and can be modified to suit individual customer needs.
<P>
The skill level required is familiarity with CICS for OS/2 and COBOL programming.
