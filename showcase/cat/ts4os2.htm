<I>CICS&#174; Transaction Server</I> for OS/2 Warp confirms the thrust of a simple to install, use and operate philosophy that has been a hallmark of Version 4.0 of this Transaction Server. It provides a comprehensive CICS API but is very sparing in its use of resources, thus performing extremely well in relatively small server machines.
<P>
<I>CICS Transaction Server</I> for OS/2 Warp, Version 4.1 contains CICS for OS/2 Version 3.1 and CICS Clients Version 2.0.2, delivering a range of technical enhancements over previous levels.
<P>
A new and flexible pricing structure is introduced to CICS Transaction Processing on the OS/2 platform, based on servers and registered users (with no option of concurrent users) at a much reduced price per user.
<P>
<I>CICS Transaction Server</I> for OS/2 Warp, Version 4.1 also includes Lotus&#174; Domino&#153; Go Webserver, for creating and accessing Internet or Intranet-enabled applications on CICS for OS/2.
