Source Code-->
<P>
The PILEOF sample is a demonstration of the PileOf object class.  This object will
inherit most of the attributes of the WPFolder class,  but it will override some
methods to implement a given behavior.
<P>
A PileOf object should:
<UL>
<LI>Enable the user to select what type of objects can be part of a given pile
<LI>Have a particular "open" behavior when the user double-clicks on a PileOf object icon
<LI>Support certain behavior for manipulating entries and for the creation of other piles
</UL>
<P>
An instance of this class can be created as a Workplace object.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> This is sample code.  Not all the PileOf behavior has been included.
<P>
Please take note that DosQueryModuleHandle ("pileof.dll -two instances- in \pileof\pileof.c")
is failing because the path for pileof.dll is not hard coded.
<P>
In config.sys, make sure your LIBPATH statement points to the directory in which the
pileof.dll was installed.
<P>
<BIG><B>Installation Instructions:</B></BIG>

<LI>Change to the directory where the PileOf install.exe resides.
<LI>At an OS/2 command prompt, type: <B>install <I>d:</I>\<I>pileof</I>\pileof.dll</B>
<P>
