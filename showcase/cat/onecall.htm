<!--<p>
<BIG><B>Source Code for "One Call Does it All"</B></BIG>-->
<P>
This C source code is provided with The Developer Connection News article, "One Call Does It All."
It contains a function called SetupPrinter() that provides a user interface to select a printer and
change the print job settings.  It returns an "info" device context (DC) and presentation space (PS),
which lets the application query the printer for information about forms, colors, fonts, and character
widths without creating an actual print job.
