This sample was designed to illustrate how the direct manipulation
classes provided by the Open Class Library can be integrated with
container controls in the Visual Builder.
<P>
This sample will display two primary frame windows. The first window
will contain a container of camera objects.  Cameras can be added to
the container by entering a location, room number and description
then pressing the "Add" button.  The second window will contain a
container of display objects.  Each display object can have a camera
object associated with it.  New displays can be added to the
container by entering a location and description then pressing the
"Add" button.  Cameras from the first window can be dragged onto
displays in the second window to change the camera associated with
the display.  When the drop occurs, a message box is displayed to
indicate the change.  Only cameras with the same location as the
display can be associated together.  When the user double-clicks on
a display, the current camera information is displayed in a message
box.
