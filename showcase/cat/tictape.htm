<h2>VisualAge for Java, Bean Editor Deluxe - R2V1 Mar. 1998 (M4) (N)</h2>
<p>This product is located on Member Disc 4.<br>
<br>

<p>
The Java sample code referenced in the March 1998 issue of the
<i>IBM Developer Connection Technical Magazine,</i> entitled <cite>VisualAge
for Java, Bean Editor Deluxe!</cite> is located in
<i><b>\tictape\TickerTape.txt</i></b> on the CD-ROM.

<p>
The code sample illustrates the seven basic guidelines to help ensure
compatibility between a bean and a visual bean editor.  The number of the
guideline matches a comment in the code sample.

<P>IBM's <I>VisualAge for Java, Bean Editor Deluxe</I> is much more than a
powerful two-way editor. In addition to aiding in the development of Java
applets and applications, the VisualAge for Java Visual Composition Editor
is a powerful application development tool for rapidly building JavaBean
components and for assembling applications composed of JavaBeans. Because
VisualAge for Java is based on JDK 1.1 and is <I>JavaBean aware</I>,
larger portions of an application can be generated with the VisualAge
Visual Composition Editor without the need of adding and modifying code
with a text editor. New and existing Java classes can be packaged into
JavaBean JAR files and integrated into the Visual Composition Editor with
relative ease.</P>

<P>The article introduces readers to the benefits of
basing the Visual Composition Editor on a JavaBean infrastructure and to
demonstrate the mechanics of integrating new and existing JavaBeans into
the tool. The Visual Composition Editor uses JavaBeans in three ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Allows third-party JavaBeans to be imported into the VisualAge
workspace and added to the Visual Composition Editor's palette.</LI>
<LI>Allows developers to assemble, manipulate, and connect JavaBeans to
create applets, applications, and new JavaBean classes.</LI>
<LI>Generates JavaBean conforming components and source code. </LI>
</UL>
