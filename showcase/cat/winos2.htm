<P>
This product provides sample code for the article "Communication between OS/2 and WIN-OS/2" in
Volume 4 of The Developer Connection News.
<P>
The article provides a working model that allows the OS/2 and WIN-OS/2 process
to send messages to each other, as well as display them to the console.  You can
expand on this simple model so the messages can be broadcast to all processes that are
registered, or to a designated process within a group of registered processes.
