<P>
This is a sample program to terminate the applications quickly and cleanly at the right time.
<P>
Applications, unlike operating systems, have to terminate.  As programmers, we concentrate
on the loading and running of our applications, but we often skimp on termination.  As a
program grows in complexity, with multiple processes, threads, DLLs,
semaphores, and shared memory, termination becomes a complex issue.
