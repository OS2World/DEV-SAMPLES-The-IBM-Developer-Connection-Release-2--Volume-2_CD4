<P>
Animate can be used to create the illusion and effect of animation using bitmaps and timers.
<P>
Animate1 shows how a series of similar bitmaps can be used to create the illusion of
animation when combined with a timer.  This program loads a series of bitmaps and starts
a timer.  Each time the timer "ticks" a new bitmap is drawn in the same
location as the previous one giving the impresson that objects are moving.
<P>
Animate2 show how a series of animation frames contained in a single (wide and narrow)
bitmap and can be used to create the effect of animation.  This program loads the bitmap
and walks through it displaying each frame with a time delay between each
one.
<p>
Refer the corresponding article in Volume 12 of The Developer Connection News for more
information on these animation techniques.
