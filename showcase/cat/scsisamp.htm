<!--<P>

<b>Platform:</b> AIX-->
<P>
This sample device driver is an example of the interface between a SCSI device
driver head and a SCSI adapter device driver.  The head (which is what this sample
represents) is the upper layer in the AIX V3 SCSI subsystem and it talks to the adapter
driver.  It does not talk directly to the SCSI adapter.  The adapter driver is the lower
layer which talks to the SCSI adapter and other system hardware.  The two layers communicate
via system calls.
