    <H2>Navigating the IBM Developer Connection Catalog</H2>
    
    <P>Navigating the <I>IBM Developer Connection</I> catalog is easy. Along
      the right side of the browser window is a column containing the <I>Views
      Option</I> and a list of the major topics or categories contained in the
      catalog. The right portion of the browser window contains the <I>Presentation</I>
      area where selected information is shown. Above the Presentations area is
      a set of buttons. The <I>Search</I> and <I>Help</I> buttons are
      additional navagation aids to help you use and locate information in the
      catalog. </P>
    
    <H2>Search Button</H2>
    
    <P>When you click on the <I>Search</I> button, a search dialog window is
      shown. The dialog window contains the following fields: </P>
    <OL>
      <LI><I>Enter word or words to be searched for:</I> Enter the search
        criteria, or keywords, to locate topics that are of interest to you. The
        following rules apply to the keywords entered:
        <UL>
          <LI>Asterisk (*) is a placeholder for zero or more characters </LI>
          <LI>Question mark (?) is a placeholder for exactly one character
          </LI>
          <LI>Question mark, asterisk (?*) mean one or more </LI>
          <LI>???..* means N or more </LI>
          <LI>Backslash, asterisk (\*) is '*' </LI>
          <LI>Backslash, question mark (\?) is '?' </LI>
          <LI>Double backslash (\\) is '\' </LI>
          <LI>Backslash, x (\x) where x !={*,?,\} is x </LI>
        </UL>
        
        <P>The search criteria may contain more than one word and is not
          case-sensitive. For example, the search string 'i?m a*x' matches all
          documents containing three-letter words that begin with &quot;i&quot;
          and ending with &quot;m,&quot; like &quot;ibm.&quot; The search string
          also matches all n-letter words beginning with &quot;a&quot; and
          ending with &quot;x,&quot; like &quot;aix.&quot; </P>
        
        <P>To search for a set of characters which are a substring of other
          words, you must use the '*' or '?' to find the full words where that
          substring occurs. </P>
        
        <P>An index-based search is performed, when you press <B>Enter</B> or
          click on the <I>Search</I> button in the Search dialog window. The
          index references the catalog entries, HTML and ASCII documents, and
          ASCII source code related files on the CD. </P>
        
        <P>If you would like to search INF documents, an OS/2-based browser is
          also provided on your CD. You can use it to search INF and ASCII files
          on Member Level Disc 1. From an OS/2 command prompt, change to the
          root directory of the drive where Member Level Disc 1 is located.
          Then, type <B>browseos2</B> to start the browser. Through this
          interface, you can search files located in the <TT>\os2docs</TT>
          directory. </P>  </LI>
      <LI><I>Maximum Number of hits accepted:</I> This is the number of items
        matching the search criteria that will be shown. The default is 100. To
        see search results faster, reduce the number of hits accepted.
        <BR></LI>
      <LI><I>Keywords matched:</I> Select <I>All</I> to see catalog entries
        that contain only the word or words that meet the search criteria. This
        is the default. Select <I>Any</I> to see catalog entries that contain
        any of the words that meet the search critiera.
        <BR></LI>
      <LI><I>Search Scope:</I> If this option is shown, select <I>Everything</I>
        to search catalog entries and documentation containing the word or words
        that meet the search criteria. This is the default. Select <I>Catalog
        Only</I> to search only catalog entries that meet the search word
        criteria. To see search results faster, limit the search scope to <I>Catalog
        Only</I>. </LI>
    </OL>
    
    <H2>Help Button</H2>
    
    <P>Select the <I>Help</I> button and help information is shown in a
      separate browser window. <I>You are currently reading the file displayed
      when you select this Help button.</I> </P>
    
    <P>Help information is provided for each area on the first page of the <I>IBM
      Developer Connection</I> catalog. </P>
    
    <H2>Views Option</H2>
    
    <P>The <I>Views</I> option is available only if you are using the
      Java-based interface. This option allows you to select a specific
      operating system platform, subscription level or issue of Developer
      Connection CDs and view only the offerings for that platform, subscription
      level or CD set. </P>
    
    <P>For example, to see only the offerings for the AIX platform, select AIX
      from the Views pull-down menu and a list of products and topics pertaining
      to AIX is shown. If you allow the mouse to &quot;hover&quot; over an
      entry, the complete text for that entry is shown on the Status bar on the
      bottom of the interface. </P>
    
    <P>The Views Option window is located above the list of categories or
      subjects along the left side of the user interface. Click on the arrow to
      open the pull-down menu and a list of choices is shown. You also may type
      a topic or product in the window to limit the information shown. </P>
    
    <H2>Table of Contents</H2>
    
    <P>The <I>Table of Contents,</I> or <I>catalog</I> is a list of the
      categories for the types of products and documents available in this
      volume. This catalog is updated on a regular basis as new products and
      information becomes available. Check it periodically to ensure you are
      viewing the latest technology available on products of interest to you.
    </P>
    
    <P>A blue arrow in front of the entry indicates additional entries, or
      subheadings, that are available for that category. Selecting the blue
      arrow, or the category name, expands or collapses an entry. When a
      category is expanded, a list of additional subcategories or, at the lowest
      level, the titles of actual products or documents, is shown. Click on an
      entry to display product information or a document in the Presentation
      Area. </P>
    
    <P>You can navigate the categories by expanding and collapsing the areas
      that interest you, or you can use the <I>Search</I> to find a specific
      title or phrase. </P>
    
    <P>Products in this November release are designated as New (N) or Updated
      (U) in Red. Products with Time-Out code are noted with a (T). Disc numbers
      where the products are located are shown preceded by the subscription
      level. For example, M1 following the product name denotes Member Level
      Disc 1, A3 denotes Advanced Level Disc 3, and P2 denotes Premier Level
      Disc 2. </P>
    
    <P>Documents in several formats other than HTML can be displayed from the
      catalog. Refer to the README.TXT file in the root directory of the CD for
      instructions on installing and configuring your browser for document
      formats that you currently cannot display. For example, Adobe Acrobat
      Reader is provided for viewing PDF files. </P>
    
    <H2>Presentation Area</H2>
    
    <P>The <I>Presentation Area</I> and the catalog are linked. When an entry
      in the catalog is selected, the information for that entry is shown in the
      large Presentation Area on the right side of the browser window. </P>
    
    <H2>User's Guide</H2>
    
    <P>The User's Guide is available in HTML or in ASCII format. On the CDs,
      you can refer to /usrguide.txt. On the Web or on the CDs, you can view the
      HTML version of the <A HREF="../usrguide.htm" TARGET="_blank">User's
        Guide</A>. </P>
