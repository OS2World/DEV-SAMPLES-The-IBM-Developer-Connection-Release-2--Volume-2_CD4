INTRODUCTION
------------

This SupportPac provides a sample ECI OLE Automation Server showing how
an OLE 'business object' can be built using the CICS Client C++ Class
Libraries.  Such an OLE object can provide a very convenient way for a
Visual Basic or LotusScript user to access business data from CICS.

IBM CICS Client V2.0 already provides a general purpose OLE Automation
Server for the ECI (CCLOECI.EXE).  This SupportPac shows how to
construct an application-specific version of CCLOECI.  This sample
shows how to hide the CICS interface logic from the end users, and how
to process the CICS commarea to provide convenient Visual Basic
datatypes.

Note:  

  SupportPac CA57 illustrates an alternative strategy, which is to
  provide an OLE object specifically to handle the commarea data.  This
  would be used together with (rather than instead of) CCLOECI.


INSTALLATION
------------

To install the SupportPac, copy the file CA58.ZIP to a temporary
directory and uncompress using InfoZip's Unzip.  Use the default
options to ensure the subdirectories stored in the ZIP file are
re-created.

The following subdirectories will be created:

  cclosamp - Sample ECI OLE Automation Server 'CCLOSAMP' 

  server   - Sample CICS 'back-end' C program 'ECISAMP' 

  vb       - Sample Visual Basic testcase 'SAMPLE'  


USAGE
-----

1. Sample ECI OLE Automation Server (CCLOSAMP)

This is a C++ GUI dialog application generated using the Microsoft
VisualC++ V4.2 Wizard, with OLE Automation enabled.  An OLE interface
"Ccl.Sample" has been added with several methods to support the sample
'business object' functions.  Calls to the CICS Client Class Library
(CCLCPW32.LIB) have been added to provide the connection to the CICS
server.

Note: 

  The OLE object must be registered before the Visual Basic testcase
  can be run. To register the object run CCLOSAMP.EXE. The executable 
  is provided in the /Release subdirectory. It uses the Microsoft
  Visual C++ V4.2 MFC DLLs, so if you are using a level other V4.2 you
  will need to rebuild CCLOSAMP.EXE before running it.

The sample comprises the following files:
 
CcloSamp.h

  This is the main header file for the OLE application.  It includes
  other project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares
  the CcloSampApp application class and the CcloSamp OLE class
  (CCmdTarget subclass).

CcloSamp.cpp

  This is the main application source file that contains the
  application class CcloSampApp and the OLE class CcloSamp.  The
  CcloSamp class supports the Ccl.Sample object used from Visual Basic,
  and its GetInfo, GetDate, GetServerName, GetServerDesc and
  SetServerName methods.

cclosamp.odl

  This file contains the Object Description Language source code for
  the type library of your application.  From the .odl file the .tlb
  file is built.  This provides the user help available in the Visual
  Basic Object Browser.

cclosamp.clw

  This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing
  classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store
  information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data
  maps and to create prototype member functions.

CcloDlg.h, CcloDlg.cpp 

  These files contain the CCLSAMP dialog classes.  These classes define
  the behavior of the CCLOSAMP application's main and 'about' dialogs.
  The dialog templates are in cclosamp.rc.

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp

  These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named
  cclosamp.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h

  This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.  MS
  Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

cclosamp.rc res\cclosamp.rc2

  These are the resources that the sample program uses.

res\cclosamp.ico

  This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This
  icon is included by the main resource file cclosamp.rc.


2. Sample back-end CICS server program (ECISAMP)

A back-end CICS C program is provided in subdirectory /server.  This
program has been designed to run under Transaction Server for OS/2, and
can be built and installed using the utility CICSCTCL.CMD.

ecisamp.ccs

  CICS C program to query the CICS server details and date/time,
  returning this information in the commarea.

3. Sample Visual Basic testcase (SAMPLE)

A Visual Basic V4.0 test application is provided in subdirectory /vb.
This shows how an end-user Visual Basic or Lotuscript program would
create and use the methods on the OLE 'business object'.

Note: 

  The OLE Automation Server 'CCLOSAMP' must be registered, and the
  back-end CICS server program installed (see above), before this
  testcase can be run.

Note: 

  To use the VB Object Browser to view the CCLOSAMP interface you will
  need to add a reference to CCLOSAMP.TLB in the /cclosamp/Release
  subdirectory.

Sample.vbp

  Visual Basic project file.

Form.frm

  Visual Basic form definition and program logic.
