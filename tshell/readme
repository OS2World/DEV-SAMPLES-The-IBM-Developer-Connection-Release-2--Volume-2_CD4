INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TShell is a reduced-function shell for OS/2. Reduced function
means that more system resources are available to applications.
TShell is small and does well in 4MB RAM.

TShell is a text-only shell for OS/2. There is no Presentation
Manager under TShell. TShell runs DOS and OS/2 programs, but not
PM programs. There are other restrictions; see below.

TShell has applications in low-resource systems, servers, embedded
systems, floppy boots, and test beds.

TShell is IBM Employee Written Software. Please read the "as-is"
license agreement from IBM. Essentially, you use this program "as
is," and IBM makes no warranty about the correctness of this program
or its suitability to any purpose.










INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install a plain-text editor such as TEDIT.EXE from OS/2 Warp.

2. Make a backup copy of CONFIG.SYS.

3. Copy TSHELL.EXE into the root directory of the bootup drive.

4. Edit CONFIG.SYS and change the PROTSHELL setting to

            PROTSHELL=\TSHELL.EXE

5. (OPTIONAL) Copy PGMSHELL.EXE into your PATH.










USING TSHELL
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A session under OS/2 is a "virtual console" consisting of a virtual
keyboard and a virtual display. TShell and OS/2 support multiple
virtual sessions. Only one session at a time may occupy the real
computer console; this is called the foreground session.

Use TShell hot keys CTRL-ESC and ALT-ESC to switch sessions.
Ctrl-Esc switches to TShell, and Alt-Esc switches to the next
session in queue.

The basic functions of TShell are to

  . start a new session
  . switch to a session
  . kill a session
  . shutdown the system

On the left of the TShell screen is the "Start Group," a list of
startable sessions. To start a session, highlight an item with the
cursor keys and press Enter. Customize this list with PGMSHELL.EXE.

On the right of the TShell screen is the "Running Group," a list of
active sessions. To switch to a session, highlight the item and press
Enter.

Tab, left arrow, or right arrow keys navigate the two lists. Double
border indicates the active list.

To kill a session, highlight the program in the Running Group and
press Delete. TShell deletes the session immediately.

To shutdown, end all running sessions, then select "Shutdown System."












RESTRICTIONS AND KNOWN BUGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TShell works on OS/2 2.0 and later.

TShell will not run programs that require Presentation Manager. TShell
does not initialize PM. Some TShell/Warp systems hang when running a PM
application by mistake.

TShell does not spool. If you have no printer attached, and you
accidentally press Print-Screen, wait for the parallel port to timeout:
up to two minutes. See SetParallelTimeout() function below for a
workaround.

Some DOS programs query/drive the printer with INT 17h. INT 17h in OS/2
DOS does work correctly because it always reports that the printer is
on line, even when off line. Since there is no spooler under TShell, this
can be a problem for some DOS applications. NEW17.COM is a DOS TSR which
might work around this error.

TShell does not start the file system cache program for HPFS. Start
CACHE.EXE somewhere in STARTUP.CMD.

REXX works (if present) but REXX utilities DLL (REXXUTIL.DLL) does not.

The START /DOS command does not work right.  CMD.EXE should start a DOS
session, but it incorrectly starts an OS/2 session.  Get my STARTDOS
package (STARTD.ZIP) for a workaround.

Programmers using DosStartSession() API must use appropriate lengths for the
STARTDATA structure. Valid lengths are 24, 30, and 32 (decimal).

IBM LAN Server version 3.01 or higher works with TShell.

If TShell has a shutdown option on the menu, end all running programs
first, then it works. If not, press Ctrl-Alt-Del, wait a second for the
disk activity light to go out, and power off. This is a clean shutdown.

Starting more than 12 sessions can cause a system hang. For best results,
limit your sessions to 12.

TShell works best with swapping turned on, MEMMAN=SWAP in CONFIG.SYS.
If running NOSWAP, compute your RAM requirements carefully.

TShell on Warp has problems running WinOS2 in a DOS session. WinOS2
works much better on OS/2 2.1 and 2.11. PMDD.SYS, if left installed, may
cause a hang in DOS-less configurations on Warp.










PGMSHELL.EXE: PROGRAMMING THE TSHELL START LIST
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage: PGMSHELL <REXX cmd file>

You can modify TShell's list of startable programs by writing a
script in REXX and invoking it via the utility PGMSHELL.EXE.
PGMSHELL collects data from REXX and passes it to TShell.

PGMSHELL is optional. If you never use PGMSHELL, TShell will
provide a default list of items to start. PGMSHELL requires REXX.




/* Sample REXX program to modify the TShell start list  */

if 'PGMSHELL' <> address() then do
  say 'Expected PGMSHELL environment.'
  say 'Usage:  PGMSHELL <cmd filename>'
  return 2
end

/* TShell does not spool, so reduce parallel port timeout
from 120 to 5 seconds in case you accidentally hit print-screen
and there is no printer hooked up. */
rc = SetParallelTimeout( "LPT1", 5 )

/* title text for the start list  */
rc = SetStartTitle( "Start Group" )

/* title text for the running list  */
rc = SetRunningTitle( "Running Group" )

/* Add OS2 program; arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, exe */
/* I omit the title of CMD.EXE session, then CMD.EXE will dynamically */
/* update the title based on the currently-running program. */
rc = AddOS2Program( "",,,"CMD.EXE" )

/* Add OS2 program; arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, exe */
rc = AddOS2Program( "Format Floppy",,"A:","FORMAT.COM" )

/* is configured for DOS? */
if QueryDOSCapable() then do
  /* Add DOS program;
  arguments: title, startup dir, parameters, settings stem */
  drop settings
  settings.0 = "DPMI_DOS_API=ENABLED"
  settings.1 = "DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT=8"
  rc = AddDOSProgram( "DPMI DOS Session",,, "settings" )
end

/* add shutdown option. arguments: title, completion msg */
rc = AddShutdown( "Shutdown", "Shutdown Complete" )

/* make text white on blue; 0=black; 1=blue; 2=green; 3=cyan; 4=red;
5=pink; 6=orange; 7=white */
rc = SetForegroundColor( 7 )
rc = SetBackgroundColor( 1 )
return 0

/************* end of code *************/





These special functions are available to REXX programs under the PGMSHELL
environment:


SetParallelTimeout( portname, timeout in decimal seconds )
   Sets the parallel port timeout. Set the port timeout to zero if there
   is no printer attached.

SetStartTitle( start group title )
   Sets the title text above the list of startable programs.

SetRunningTitle( running group title )
   Sets the title text above the list of running programs.

SetBackgroundColor( n ), SetForegroundColor( n )
   Sets the text colors of the TShell screen. N is a number from zero
   to seven.

   0 black
   1 blue
   2 green
   3 cyan
   4 red
   5 pink
   6 orange
   7 white

   Default background color is 0; default foreground color is 7.

QueryDOSCapable()
   Returns a Boolean indicating if the system is configured to emulate DOS.

AddOS2Program( title, startup dir, parameters, EXE )
   Adds an OS/2, protected-mode program to the start list.

AddDOSProgram( title, startup dir, command.com arguments, settings stem )
   Adds a DOS mode program to the start list. ALL elements of the stem
   variable are considered DOS settings. Therefore, drop the stem variable
   before assigning DOS settings to it.  For help with DOS settings,
   1) see the settings dialog in Workplace Shell or 2) obtain my
   STARTDOS package and run settings.exe, a PM application.

AddShutdown( shutdown title, shutdown complete message )
   Adds the shutdown option to the start group.
