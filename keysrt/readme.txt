KEYSRT.ZIP contains a sample of a wrapper non-visual part for
IVKeySortedSet collection.

The instructions in the README file can also be used for
implementing other collections (i.e IVxxxxxx ) that require
2 or more template parameters.

See the readme file in KEYSRT.zip for more details on using the part.
