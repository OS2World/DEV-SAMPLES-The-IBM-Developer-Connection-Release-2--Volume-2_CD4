   IF YOU DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS SUPPORTPAC YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS

   International  Business  Machines  Corporation grants you a license to
   use the SupportPac only in the country  where  you  acquired  it.  The

       your enterprise.

   o   Modify the SupportPac and merge it into another program.

   o   Make copies of the original file you download  and  distribute  it
       only  if  you do not charge for copies of the SupportPac, provided
       that you transfer a copy of this license to the other  party.  The
       other  party  agrees  to  these  terms  by  its  first  use of the
       SupportPac.

   You must reproduce the  copyright  notice  and  any  other  legend  of
   ownership on each copy or partial copy, of the SupportPac.

   You may NOT:

   o   Reverse  assemble,  reverse  compile,  or  otherwise translate any

   intellectual property infringement.

   Under no circumstances are we liable for any of the following:

   1.  Third-party claims against you for losses or damages

   2.  Loss of, or damage to, your records or data

   3.  Economic consequential damages (including lost profits or savings)
       or  incidental  damages,  even  if  we  are  informed   of   their
       possibility.

   Some  jurisdictions  do  not allow these limitations or exclusions, so
   they may not apply to you.

   We do not  warrant  uninterrupted  or  error  free  operation  of  the
   SupportPac.    We  have  no  obligation  to  provide  service,  defect
   correction, or any  maintenance  for  the  SupportPac.    We  have  no
   obligation  to  supply  any  SupportPac updates or enhancements to you

   THERE  ARE  NO  WARRANTIES,  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE

   so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

   relating to your use of the SupportPac, you grant IBM a non-exclusive,
   royalty-free, irrevocable, unrestricted and world-wide license to use,
   have used and make copies in case of documents, such Feedback  in  any

   license if you fail to comply with any of its terms.  In either event,
   you must destroy all your copies of the SupportPac.

   You are responsible for the payment of any taxes resulting  from  this
   license.

   or obligations under this license.  Any attempt to do so is void.
